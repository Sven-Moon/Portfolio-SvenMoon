            SpellWell performs a comparative analysis of calculated hit
            percentages between spell types. Do I use the constitution-save
            spell or the intelligence-save spell? For a simple tabletop fantasy
            game, there's a surprising amount of variables that goes into
            optimizing that answer. This app seeks to pull all of those
            variables together and come up with an actual answer to "Which is
            the best spell?"
          </p>
          <p class="project-details__desc-para">
            A quick note: for most people, this directly detracts from the fun
            of the game. But for analytically-minded people like me, that
            doesn't matter. The fun is not in vanquishing foes, but in finding
            the high point in the graph.

          <h3 class="project-details__content-title">SpellWell's Future</h3>
          <p class="project-details__desc-para">
            I'll set up authentication pretty quickly here so people can save
            their characters and develop a log of monsters they know. The posted
            image shows a 'Spell List', but that doesn't exist right now. There
            are hundreds of D&D spells, so I'll have to rely on an API to
            provide them and I just haven't had the time to connect to one yet.
            I'll also use the API to give players the opportunity to just choose
            the monster and have its stats filled in.
          </p>
          <p class="project-details__desc-para">
            A final note: If none of this makes sense to you, you're probably
            neither a numbers nor RPG role playing geek. That's okay. That
            probably makes you more normal rather than less.
